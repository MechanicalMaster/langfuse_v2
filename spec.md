**Project Specification: Memory-Persistent Chatbot with FAISS-Based Policy Retrieval and Observability**

---

### 1. Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a chatbot that maintains a continuous conversation thread with memory, retrieves answers from a FAISS vector store (populated from uploaded policy documents), and provides observability through Langfuse. The system will feature a very basic web-based frontend for chatting and a dedicated page for uploading policy documents. Once uploaded, these documents will be sent to OpenAI for embeddings, and the resulting embeddings will be stored on disk using FAISS. During a chat session, the chatbot will refer to the FAISS vector store for answers. If the relevant information is available in the FAISS store, the bot will answer; otherwise, it will decline to answer.

### 2. Core Functionalities

#### 2.1 Chatbot Core
- **Conversational Flow:**  
  The chatbot will be built using LangChain and LangGraph, enabling persistent memory and a multi-turn conversation thread.
- **Retrieval Mechanism:**  
  Instead of relying on a static file, the bot will use a FAISS vector store as its primary knowledge base.
- **Answering Policy Queries:**  
  The chatbot will retrieve responses by querying the FAISS vector store. If the retrieved answer meets a relevance threshold, it will be provided to the user; otherwise, the bot will decline to answer.

#### 2.2 Memory Management
- **Session Memory:**  
  LangGraph will manage conversation history using persistent memory mechanisms so that context is preserved across turns.
- **User Sessions:**  
  Unique session identifiers (thread IDs) will be used to ensure continuity across user interactions.

#### 2.3 FAISS Vector Store Retrieval
- **Policy Upload Interface:**  
  A secondary page (e.g., `policy.html`) will be provided to allow users/admins to upload policy documents.
- **Embeddings Generation:**  
  Upon upload, the document will be processed and sent to OpenAI for generating embeddings.
- **FAISS Storage:**  
  The generated embeddings will be stored in a FAISS vector store on disk (within a designated folder). This FAISS store acts as the searchable knowledge base.
- **Querying During Chat:**  
  During chat interactions, the chatbot will query the FAISS vector store for policy-related answers. If a relevant answer is found, it will be returned; otherwise, the chatbot will state that the information is not available.

#### 2.4 Observability with Langfuse
- **Logging and Monitoring:**  
  Langfuse will be integrated to log interactions, track query response times, and monitor retrieval successes or failures.
- **Metadata Capture:**  
  The system will capture detailed metadata such as user session details, query logs, response times, and information on whether a policy document answer was found in FAISS.

### 3. User Interaction & Frontend

#### 3.1 Chat Interface
- **Minimalist Web Chat:**  
  A basic web-based chat window will be provided using simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript. This interface will allow users to type messages and see responses. Itshould a sleek and professional look, timestamp for messages and dark mode.
- **Continuous Conversation:**  
  The chat interface will display the ongoing conversation history, managed by the backend memory.

#### 3.2 Policy Document Upload
- **Upload Page (policy.html):**  
  A secondary page will be created for uploading policy documents. Users can drop or select a file to be processed.
- **Feedback & Processing:**  
  Once the document is uploaded, users receive confirmation that the document is being processed (i.e., embeddings are being generated and stored).

### 4. System Architecture

#### 4.1 Components
- **Frontend:**  
  - A simple HTML/CSS/JS chat interface for conversation.
  - A dedicated upload page (`policy.html`) for policy documents.
- **Backend:**  
  - A Python API (using FastAPI or Flask) to handle chat requests and file uploads.
- **Chatbot Engine:**  
  - LangChain for conversational AI.
  - LangGraph for managing conversation state and memory persistence.
  - A custom retrieval component that queries a FAISS vector store (populated with policy document embeddings).
- **Observability:**  
  - Langfuse integration for logging and monitoring.
- **Storage:**  
  - FAISS vector store saved to disk (within a specific FAISS folder) for policy document embeddings.

#### 4.2 Data Flow
1. **Policy Upload:**
   - User navigates to `policy.html` and uploads a policy document.
   - The document is sent to the backend, which sends its content to OpenAI to generate embeddings.
   - The resulting embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector store on disk.
2. **Chat Interaction:**
   - The user sends a message via the chat interface.
   - The backend retrieves the conversation history from memory (via LangGraph) using a unique session identifier.
   - The chatbot checks the FAISS vector store for a relevant answer regarding policy queries.
   - If a relevant answer is found, it is returned; otherwise, the bot declines to answer.
   - The conversation state is updated with the new turn.
3. **Observability:**
   - Every interaction, including file upload processing and chat queries, is logged in Langfuse with relevant metadata for performance monitoring and debugging.

### 5. Deployment & Scalability

- **Containerization:**  
  The entire backend, including the chatbot engine and API, will be containerized using Docker for consistency across environments.
- **Deployment Options:**  
  The system can be deployed on AWS (using ECS, EC2, or a similar service), or as a microservice via FastAPI on a VPS.
- **Persistent Storage:**  
  The FAISS vector store will be saved to disk in a dedicated folder. 
- **Observability:**  
  Langfuseâ€™s dashboard and logging services will be set up to monitor real-time interactions, response times, and system health.

### 6. Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Retrieval:**  
  Explore advanced retrieval strategies (e.g., combining keyword and vector-based search) to improve answer relevance.

### 7. Summary

This project will deliver a robust, memory-persistent chatbot that leverages FAISS as a vector store for retrieving policy-related answers. The system provides:
- A continuous conversation experience powered by LangChain and LangGraph.
- A dynamic policy retrieval system where documents are uploaded via a dedicated page, processed for embeddings, and stored in FAISS.
- A basic web chat interface for user interaction.
- Full observability and logging using Langfuse for monitoring and debugging.

The design emphasizes modularity, scalability, and ease of deployment while ensuring that the chatbot only answers queries when the required policy information is available in the FAISS vector store.
